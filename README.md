# StarWarsRP Gamemode
StarWarsRP gamemode for Garry's Mod (Built on DarkRP by https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP)

# Server Installation
1. Download the Zip file and extract the contents to somewhere on your PC.
2. Navigate into 'garrysmod/gamemodes' and put the starwarsrp folder into the gamemodes folder.
3. If you are hosting the server on your own PC using a .bat file go to STEP 4, if you're running a server from a host provider using TCAdmin2 or similar go to STEP 5.
4. Right click your start.bat file and replace the gamemode value from "sandbox" to "starwarsrp". THATS IT FOR YOU!
5. Head into your game server control panel and navigate to 'Command Line Manager' and create a new custom command line, then tick the box to the left of gamemode and enter starwarsrp into the corresponding text box.
6. Start your server and enjoy your life as a Clone Trooper!!! OORAH

# Dependancies
You will need to intall the following for the gamemode to work properly:
1. If you are planning to make changes to the gamemode (such as adding new jobs etc) which you most likely are... YOU MUST install the DarkRP Modification @ https://github.com/FPtje/darkrpmodification
2. You will need to have CSS content installed on the server for the gamemode to work properly. You can download the content @ https://gmodcontent.com/
